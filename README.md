# BorrowMe+
BorrowMe+ is a mini project that was created within 24hrs by a team of 3 from Monash University. This project allow staff and student to borrow and return item with just a few clicks away. Instead of having the student to write an email to propose what item/equipment that needs to be borrowed and staff reading all the email in order to accept or deny, BorrowMe+ will ease the process on both parties.

This project work is just a prototype and is not perfect. But we hope you will enjoy our idea.

# Idea
- BorrowMe+ allow any faculty to allow student to borrow anything. 
- There are 2 platform. One for staff and One for student
  # for staff:
  - Staff can edit the amount of item inside the platform and keep track of the duration of each equipment that was borrowed
    by the students. 
  # for student:
  - Student can check if the item they desire to borrow is still available by using this platform as everything is updated to
    the live database that will be controlled by the stuff
  - There are a section where students must input the date borrowed and the date return in order for staff to approve or deny.
